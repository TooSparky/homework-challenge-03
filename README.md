# Homework-Challenge-03

## Description

The program will generate a random password based on user constraints. When you click on generate password, you will first be prompted with the length of the password that the user desires. Then you will be prompted with multiple questions of what characters the user would like to include in the password. After all the prompts, the desired password will then be outputed into the secure password area. 

## Installation

There is no installation, all you must do is visit the website, and click on the generate button. From there the prompts will follow and the output will be what the user desires. 

## Usage

It is very easy to use. Just click on the big red button that says generate password and follow the prompts! Then your password will display where the words, 'your secure password' are currently.
